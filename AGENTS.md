# traviteja.com — Agent & Contributor Guide

Personal portfolio and technical blog of **Raviteja Tholupunoori**, Senior Data Engineer & Cloud Architect with 9+ years of experience at Deloitte. Apache Airflow Champion.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro 5 (static site generation — NOT a React SPA)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages
- **CI**: Uses `npm ci` — package-lock.json must stay in sync. Never run `npm install` for new packages without committing the lockfile.
- **Live site**: https://traviteja.com

## Blog Post Format

File location: `src/content/blog/[seo-optimised-slug].md`

```markdown
---
title: "Full title here"
description: "150–160 character description with long-tail keywords. Used as meta description and OG description."
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
image: "/images/blog/[slug]/hero.png"
draft: false
---

Article content in markdown...
```

### Slug naming rules
- Lowercase, hyphen-separated
- Keyword-rich (e.g. `apache-airflow-architecture-explained` not `airflow-post`)
- Match the folder name for images: `public/images/blog/[slug]/`

### Image alt text rule
Always use descriptive, keyword-rich alt text:
```markdown
![Apache Airflow Architecture Diagram showing Scheduler, Executor and Workers](/images/blog/...)
```

---

## SEO Requirements (must follow for every new page/post)

1. **Title**: Specific, keyword-rich. Format: `Topic — Raviteja` for blog, or `Raviteja Tholupunoori | Keyword` for pages
2. **Description**: 150–160 chars, include long-tail keywords, no generic text
3. **Image**: Hero image in `public/images/blog/[slug]/` with SEO filename (e.g. `apache-airflow-architecture-diagram.png`)
4. **Tags**: 3–5 lowercase tags relevant to the content
5. **Sitemap**: Add new URL to `public/sitemap.xml` — copy an existing `<url>` block and update `<loc>`
6. **H2/H3 hierarchy**: One H1 (the title), H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections

---

## Writing Style Guide

All blog content must sound **human-written and personal**. Raviteja writes from his own experience as a senior data engineer.

### Voice & Tone
- First-person throughout ("I", "my", "in my experience")
- Direct and opinionated — state views clearly, don't hedge everything
- Conversational but technically credible
- Admit uncertainty where it exists ("still figuring out...", "honestly...")

### Structure rules
- **Vary sentence length** — mix short punchy sentences with longer ones. Never uniform.
- **Short paragraphs** — 2–4 lines max. Single-sentence paragraphs are fine for emphasis.
- **No perfect parallel lists everywhere** — use prose where possible, lists only when genuinely list-like
- **No corporate transitions** — avoid "In conclusion", "To summarize", "It is worth noting"
- **No AI tells** — avoid "It is important to note", "This is not just X, it is Y", "Let's explore", "In the X era"

### What to include
- Specific examples from real projects (Airflow, CDP, Spark, LG Electronics, Deloitte)
- Honest takes on what was hard or what failed
- Practical advice grounded in real experience, not generic theory

### What to avoid
- Generic "here's what the documentation says" content
- Lists of 5 identical bullet points
- Formal academic tone
- Anything that reads like it was generated by AI

## Workflow: Adding a New Blog Post

1. Research the topic (web search for recent developments, examples, real data)
2. Write the article following the writing style guide above
3. Choose an SEO-optimised slug
4. Create `src/content/blog/[slug].md` with correct frontmatter
5. Add hero image to `public/images/blog/[slug]/` with SEO filename
6. Add entry to `public/sitemap.xml`
7. Run `npm run build` to verify no errors
8. Commit all files and push
9. Resubmit sitemap in Google Search Console

---

## Commands Available

See `/prompts` folder for reusable prompts:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `prompts/new-article.md` | Full end-to-end: research → write → publish |
| `prompts/draft-article.md` | Research + write only, saves as draft |
| `prompts/publish-article.md` | Publish an existing draft + update sitemap + push |
| `prompts/generate-article-image.md` | Generate a hero image for any blog post |

---

## Git Workflow — Branching Strategy

**Never push directly to `main`.** Every task gets its own branch and a Pull Request.

Branch naming: `type/short-description`

| Type | When |
|---|---|
| `feat/` | New feature or page |
| `post/` | New blog article |
| `fix/` | Bug fix |
| `seo/` | SEO improvements |
| `style/` | UI / design changes |
| `chore/` | Config, deps, housekeeping |

```bash
# Always start here
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b post/my-new-article

# After changes
npm run build          # must pass before committing
git add [files]
git commit -m "post: new article on [topic]"
git push origin post/my-new-article
gh pr create --title "post: new article on [topic]"
```

See `prompts/feature-branch.md` for the full workflow.

---

## Do Not

- Push directly to `main` — always use a feature branch + PR
- Run `npm install [package]` without committing the updated `package-lock.json` — CI will fail
- Use `@astrojs/sitemap` or any new Astro integration without testing CI first
- Add `og:image` with a relative path — must be absolute URL (BaseLayout handles this automatically)
- Commit to main without running `npm run build` first
