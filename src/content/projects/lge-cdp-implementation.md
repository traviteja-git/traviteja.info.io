## Overview

Designed and implemented the data ingestion architecture for LG Electronics' Customer Data Platform, consolidating customer data from disparate regional systems into a central warehouse for global analytics.

## Approach

- Architected end-to-end ETL pipelines using Talend to ingest data from multiple source systems
- Standardised data schemas across regional data sources with different formats and encodings
- Built automated scheduling and monitoring for daily data loads

## Impact

- Reduced manual data processing cycle from **18–20 days to 2–3 days**
- Enabled near-real-time customer analytics that were previously not possible
- Laid the foundation for the client's future data platform modernisation roadmap
